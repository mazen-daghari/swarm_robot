# swarm_robot
The Swarm Robot Project aims to develop a coordinated group of autonomous robots that can navigate through complex environments, avoid obstacles, and reach designated targets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The project leverages advanced algorithms, such as the A* pathfinding algorithm, to ensure efficient and collision-free navigation. The robots are equipped with LiDAR sensors to detect obstacles and communicate with each other to maintain a cohesive formation.

Objectives
Develop Autonomous Navigation: Implement algorithms that enable robots to navigate autonomously through a predefined environment while avoiding obstacles.

Implement Swarm Coordination: Ensure that robots can communicate and coordinate their movements to achieve a common goal without colliding with each other.

Enhance Obstacle Detection: Utilize LiDAR sensors to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time.

Simulate and Test: Create a simulation environment to test the algorithms and behaviors of the swarm robots before deploying them in real-world scenarios.

Key Features
Autonomous Navigation: Each robot can independently navigate towards a target while avoiding obstacles using the A* pathfinding algorithm.

Swarm Coordination: Robots communicate with each other to maintain a cohesive formation and avoid collisions.

LiDAR Sensing: Robots are equipped with LiDAR sensors to detect obstacles and adjust their paths accordingly.

Simulation Environment: A simulated environment is created using Pygame to test and visualize the behavior of the swarm robots.
